# THE PLAYERS
![Ed grew up in a musical family on Bodmin moor and has been playing trumpet since he was a boy. His love of jazz started early when he was introduced to improvisation by his trumpet teacher at school - Lloyd Davis and it has never left him. 

Ed has sung and played trumpet in a broad variety of gigging bands and studio settings over the years and is now loving the opportunity to play jazz again here in Cornwall where he grew up.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/53078dec92c96307769944e1f42a3fdeda19d327.jpg)
